# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) â€“ Agentic Healthcare AI

## 1. Context

The system must:

- Validate SOAP notes and predict service codes.
- Ensure compliance with HELFO regulations.
- Handle sensitive patient data securely.
- Support human-in-the-loop clarification when necessary.

## 2. Decision

Adopt an agentic AI architecture to automate healthcare workflows, focusing on compliance, security, and human oversight.

## 3. Rationale

- **Automation**: Streamlines validation and prediction tasks.
- **Compliance**: Ensures regulatory requirements are met.
- **Security**: Protects sensitive patient information.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Allows manual intervention when needed.

## 4. Consequences

- Improved efficiency and accuracy in healthcare documentation.
- Reduced risk of non-compliance and data breaches.
- Flexibility for human review and correction.

## 5. Alternatives Considered

- Manual validation and coding (inefficient, error-prone).
- Rule-based systems (less adaptable, harder to maintain).

## 6. References

- HELFO regulations documentation
- SOAP note standards
- Data protection guidelines
